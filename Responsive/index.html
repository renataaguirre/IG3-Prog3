                <h5>Static</h5>
                <p>Static design is fixed and does not change according to different devices or screen sizes. It is typically designed for a specific screen size or resolution and may not be optimized for other devices, leading to a poor user experience.</p>

                <h5>Adaptive</h5>
                <p>Adaptive design uses fixed layouts that are specifically designed for different devices and screen sizes. The server detects the device and delivers the appropriate layout optimized for that device. This provides a better user experience, but requires more resources to create and maintain multiple layouts.</p>

                <h5>Fluid</h5>

It provides a design that is optimized for different devices and screen sizes, without requiring multiple fixed layouts.</p>

            <h3>What is responsive?</h3>
            <p class="maintext">Responsive design is an approach to web design that aims to provide an optimal viewing and user experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. In responsive design, the layout and content of a website or application adapt and respond to the user's device, screen size, and orientation, ensuring that the website or application is usable and looks good on any device.<br><br>
                Responsive design uses a combination of flexible grids, fluid images, and CSS media queries to adjust the layout and content of a website or application based on the device characteristics. With responsive design, a single design is created that can adapt to various device sizes, eliminating the need for multiple fixed layouts for different devices.<br><br>
                The main goal of responsive design is to provide an optimal user experience by delivering a design that is easy to navigate, read, and interact with, regardless of the device used to access it. This approach can improve user engagement and satisfaction, increase conversions, and provide a better overall user experience.</p>
